# Data Analysis Summary: Insights on Media Ratings

This narrative provides insights based on a dataset consisting of media ratings, including movies and other types, across different languages. The analysis covers key attributes, missing values, summary statistics, and correlations among various metrics.

## Overview of the Dataset

The dataset comprises several key columns, including:

- **date**: The date of the rating.
- **language**: The language in which the media is available.
- **type**: The type of media (such as movie, series, etc.).
- **title**: The title of the media.
- **by**: The name of the reviewer.
- **overall**: The overall rating given, on a scale from 1 to 5.
- **quality**: A rating reflecting the quality of the media.
- **repeatability**: A rating for repeatability, on a scale from 1 to 3.

### Missing Values

The dataset has some missing values:
- **date**: 99 missing entries, which could affect time-related analyses.
- **by**: 262 missing entries, which indicates potential missing reviews or user identifiers.

## Summary Statistics

### Rating Distributions

Here are the key statistics for the ratings:

- **Overall Rating**: 
  - Mean: 3.05
  - Standard Deviation: 0.76
  - Ratings predominantly fall within the range of 1 to 5.
  
- **Quality Rating**: 
  - Mean: 3.21
  - Standard Deviation: 0.80
  - Shows a similar range with most ratings centered around 3 to 4.

- **Repeatability Rating**:
  - Mean: 1.49
  - Standard Deviation: 0.60
  - Values are lower, indicating that media items tend to be perceived as less repeatable.

### Distribution of Language and Type

- **Languages**: The dataset covers 11 unique languages, with **English** being the most frequent (1306 entries).
  
- **Types of Media**: Movies dominate the dataset with 2211 entries, showcasing a strong bias towards this type.

### Top Titles and Contributors

- **Top Title**: "Kanda Naal Mudhal" with 9 entries.
- **Top Reviewer**: "Kiefer Sutherland" with 48 entries.

## Correlation Analysis

The correlation matrix provides insights into how various ratings are interrelated:

|             | Overall | Quality | Repeatability |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------------|
| Overall     | 1.00    | 0.83    | 0.51          |
| Quality     | 0.83    | 1.00    | 0.31          |
| Repeatability| 0.51   | 0.31    | 1.00          |

### Insights:
- There is a strong positive correlation (0.83) between **Overall Rating** and **Quality Rating**, which suggests that higher quality media tends to receive better overall ratings.
- The correlation between **Overall Rating** and **Repeatability** is also notable (0.51), suggesting that media that scores well overall is somewhat likely to be rated as repeatable.

## Visualizations

### 1. Distribution of Ratings

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Sample data creation
overall_ratings = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5] * 442  # Simulating overall ratings
quality_ratings = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] * 530  # Simulating quality ratings

# Set up the matplotlib figure
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

# Overall Ratings Plot
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
sns.histplot(overall_ratings, kde=True, bins=10)
plt.title('Distribution of Overall Ratings')
plt.xlabel('Overall Rating')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')

# Quality Ratings Plot
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
sns.histplot(quality_ratings, kde=True, bins=10)
plt.title('Distribution of Quality Ratings')
plt.xlabel('Quality Rating')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### 2. Correlation Heatmap

```python
# Importing libraries
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Creating correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = [[1.0, 0.83, 0.51], [0.83, 1.0, 0.31], [0.51, 0.31, 1.0]]
heatmap = sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', xticklabels=['Overall', 'Quality', 'Repeatability'], yticklabels=['Overall', 'Quality', 'Repeatability'])

plt.title('Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()
```

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that the dataset contains a wealth of information predominantly centered around English movies, with average ratings in the moderate range. Strong correlations exist between overall ratings and quality, which could be pivotal for further investigations and strategic decisions in media selection and evaluation.

Future analysis should focus on addressing the missing values and diving deeper into trends over time and across different languages and types of media for a more comprehensive understanding.
