# Insights from Book Data Analysis

This analysis presents various insights derived from a dataset containing information on 10,000 books. This dataset includes details such as authors, publication year, average ratings, and the distribution of ratings from 1 to 5 stars.

## Overview of the Dataset

The dataset consists of the following key columns:

- **Authors**: Total of 4,664 unique authors, with Stephen King being the most prolific, contributing to 60 books.
- **Publication Years**: Books in the dataset span a wide range of publication years, with an average publication date in 1982.
- **Languages**: Among the books, 8,916 rows provide language codes, with English (code 'eng') being the most common.
- **Ratings**: The average rating across all books is approximately 4.00 with significant variance in total ratings.

### Missing Values
There are several columns with missing values, notably:
- **ISBN**: 700 missing values.
- **ISBN13**: 585 missing values.
- **Original Titles**: 585 missing values.
- **Language Codes**: 1,084 missing values.
- **Publication Year**: 21 missing values.

### Summary Statistics
Below are some summary statistics of key numerical features from the dataset:

| Feature                 | Mean          | Standard Deviation | Minimum | Maximum |
|-------------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------|---------|
| Average Rating          | 4.00          | 0.25                | 2.47    | 4.82    |
| Ratings Count           | 54,001        | 157,370             | 2,716   | 4,780,653|
| Work Ratings Count      | 59,687        | 167,804             | 5,510   | 4,942,365|
| Work Text Reviews Count  | 2,920        | 6,124               | 3       | 155,254 |

## Correlation Insights
A correlation analysis highlights the relationships between various numerical features. Key observations include:

- **Rating Counts** have a high correlation with work ratings count (**0.995**) and work text reviews count (**0.779**). This indicates that books with more overall ratings tend to also have a higher number of work ratings and text reviews.
- Conversely, **books count** shows a negative correlation with ratings count (-0.373), suggesting that books with more individual books may receive less overall ratings. 

## Visualizations

### Distribution of Average Ratings

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(data['average_rating'], bins=20, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Average Ratings')
plt.xlabel('Average Rating')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

### Rating Counts Breakdown

```python
# Bar plot showing the breakdown of total ratings
rating_labels = ['1 star', '2 stars', '3 stars', '4 stars', '5 stars']
rating_values = [data['ratings_1'].sum(), data['ratings_2'].sum(), data['ratings_3'].sum(), data['ratings_4'].sum(), data['ratings_5'].sum()]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x=rating_labels, y=rating_values)
plt.title('Total Ratings Breakdown by Stars')
plt.xlabel('Rating Stars')
plt.ylabel('Total Count')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

### Cohesion of Work Ratings with Text Reviews

```python
# Scatter plot for Work Ratings Count vs Work Text Reviews Count
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(data['work_ratings_count'], data['work_text_reviews_count'])
plt.title('Work Ratings Count vs Work Text Reviews Count')
plt.xlabel('Work Ratings Count')
plt.ylabel('Work Text Reviews Count')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

## Conclusions & Further Work

This analysis provides insights not just about the average ratings and counts of reviews, but also about the potential relationships between these variables. 

To build on these findings:
- Further investigation into the reasons behind missing data will help enhance the dataset.
- Exploring authors’ individual contributions in depth may yield interesting results.
- Analyzing changes in ratings over time could provide insights into trends in book reviews.

This dataset serves as a valuable resource for retailers, authors, and readers alike, offering critical information to help guide purchasing and reading decisions.
